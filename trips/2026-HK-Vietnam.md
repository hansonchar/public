## To Try

- Try to eat some “mien ga” - bean thread noodle with chicken soup

## Avoid

- unofficial taxis at airports (use Grab instead)
- money exchange at hotels (use ATM or officianl exchange offices)
- beware of "broken meter" excuse, or drivers who "don't have change"
- motorbikes
- ice in drinks, except at reputable restaurants
- tap water
- empty restaurants
- overpriced tourist restaurants (eat where locals eat)
- booking tours thru hotel (book directly or thru online platforms)
- buying from agressive street vendors

## Currency conversion

As a rough rule of thumb, 1 USD ≈ 26,000 VND. To quickly estimate an upper bound in USD for an amount given in VND, use the following heuristic:

1. Ignore any decimal places.
1. Divide the amount by 100,000, keeping only two decimal places.
1. Multiply the result by 4.

For example, for 260,000.55 VND: Ignore decimals → 260,000, Divide by 100,000 → 2.60, Multiply by 4 → 10.40 USD. This estimate slightly overstates the more accurate value of about 9.86 USD.
