## To Try

- Try to eat some “mien ga” - bean thread noodle with chicken soup

## Avoid

- unofficial taxis at airports (use Grab instead)
- money exchange at hotels (use ATM or officianl exchange offices)
- beware of "broken meter" excuse, or drivers who "don't have change"
- motorbikes
- ice in drinks, except at reputable restaurants
- tap water
- empty restaurants
- overpriced tourist restaurants (eat where locals eat)
- booking tours thru hotel (book directly or thru online platforms)
- buying from agressive street vendors

## Currency conversion

As a rough rule of thumb, 1 USD ≈ 26,000 VND. To quickly estimate an upper bound in USD for an amount given in VND, use the following heuristic:

1. Ignore any decimal places.
1. Divide the amount by 100,000, keeping only two decimal places.
1. Multiply the result by 4.

For example, for 260,000.55 VND: Ignore decimals → 260,000, Divide by 100,000 → 2.60, Multiply by 4 → 10.40 USD. This estimate slightly overstates the more accurate value of about 9.86 USD.

## Cash

1. For 8 days, a safe estimate is **500,000 to 1,000,000 VND (~$20–$40 USD) per person, per day** for "walking around" money (food, tips, small purchases).
1. Try to keep small denominations: **20,000 VND**, **50,000 VND**, and **100,000 VND** notes handy.
1. Avoid carrying large amount of cash in a single wallet.

**Usages**:

- small tips for drivers (**50,000 – 100,000 VND**) are standard but not mandatory.
- custom to tip your boat rower at the end of the tour (usually **50,000 – 100,000 VND per person**).
- Small Entrance Fees/Parking: If you explore areas like Mua Cave or local temples on your own, entrance fees and motorbike/bicycle parking are paid in cash.

**Withdrawal**:

- In Hanoi, Use ATMs (like **TPBank** or **VPBank** which often have no local fees) to take out 2–3 million VND at a time.
- **Before Ninh Binh**, make sure to have at least **1,000,000 VND** in small bills (**20k, 50k, 100k**) before leaving Hanoi, as ATMs are harder to find in the rural areas.
  - Not taking into account the private transportation from NinhBinh back to Hanoi will cost **1,300,000 VND**.
- **Gold shops** in Hanoi's Old Quarter, particularly along **Ha Trung Street**, generally offer more favorable rates than the airport.

**Common mistakes**:

- 20,000 vs 50,000 VND. Both are blue-ish polymer notes. Similar size and texture.
- 100,000 vs 200,000 VND. Both are green polymer notes. Same material and close in size.
- 10,000 vs 100,000 VND. Both can appear green-ish at a glance.
- 1,000 vs 2,000 VND (older paper notes). Similar brown tones.

**Practical Tips**:

1. Sort by denomination immediately after receiving change.
1. Check the number of zeros rather than color alone.
1. Pause on **blue** notes (20k vs 50k) — that’s the danger zone.
